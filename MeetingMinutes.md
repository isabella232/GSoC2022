## 05/27/2022 (regular meeting)

- [ ] start tracing the pipeline code `taskflow/algorithm/pipeline.hpp`
- [ ] have a look at `examples/data_parallel_pipeline.cpp` 
  + complete a shitty design first for tf::DataPipeline in `taskflow/algorithm/pipeline.hpp`
  + complete a shitty design first for tf::DataPipe in `taskflow/algorithm/pipeline.hpp`
  + you can enable the compilation of data_parallel_pipeline in `examples/CMakeLists.txt`
  + you may not need to derive your tf::DataPipeline from tf::Pipeline for now; duplicate the code and modify it is ok at this stage
- [ ] work on dev branch first
